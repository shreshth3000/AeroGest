# AeroGest- A REAL-TIME HAND GESTURE RECOGNITION MODEL FOR DRONE CONTROL

This project implements a custom Convolutional Neural Network that takes webcam images as training input.
It then creates a csv file to store the image data and an h5 file to store the weights of the CNN model trained on this data.
It also includes a speech recognition feature that takes in real-time microphone input and using Gemini API, 
cleans the recognized input and outputs a command for the drone.

### Technologies used:
- **OpenCV**
- **Tensorflow**
- **Keras**
- **SpeechRecognizer**
- **Gemini API**
